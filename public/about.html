<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Art and music are basic human functions. Humankind and art cannot function without one another. We have the burning desire 
  to create, whatever it may be and however tiny or grand. The interaction with sound is unavoidable, either to make it or take
  pleasure in it. People have always found music significant in their lives, whether for enjoyment in listening, the emotional 
  response, performing, or creating</p>

<p>This is no different for classical music or contemporary concert music. Both musics have immense worth for our society;
  however, the problem we all know in this field is that this music is little known and hence underappreciated. As a musician
  and artist it is my responsibility that others can learn to enjoy the art for which I have utter passion.
  It goes without saying that in mainstream American culture, classical or concert music is not a huge part of people's lives. 
  There are still stigmas that contribute to this, as well as the practices of the government in the last two decades (declining 
  music education in schools on the local level, resistance to increased NEA funding and less visibility of the arts on the national
  level; let us hope that the Obama administration can start to reverse these trends). Many people may still believe that classical 
  music is for the rich, older, and the well-educated. Others may feel awkward about going to classical music events because they feel 
  as if they need to act and dress a certain way in order to enter the concert or recital hall. </p>

<p>Even more, the pretentiousness and elitism that some artists exhibit is amplified by some television shows, commercials, plays, books,
  by people of influence and even themselves, which distance musicians from mainstream society. While some of this is true, as with nearly 
  any stereotype, it is not entirely true. With the impression that concert music has on society, the majority decide that it is not "for them" 
  simply because they believe it has no relevance or worth to their lives. This is further compounded by the past government's lack of interest
  in promoting and supporting the arts, whether it is to fund arts organizations or arts education. Now, the current government give us hope and 
  we have seen evidence of its commitment; but most importantly our American society needs to believe that everyone can find worth and enjoyment 
  in classical/concert music.</p>
